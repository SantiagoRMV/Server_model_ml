# Server_model_ml
## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning models using Scikit-learn. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

## Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Prepare your dataset by running the preprocessing script.
    ```bash
    python preprocess.py
    ```
2. **Model Training**: Train the model using the training script.
    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model.
    ```bash
    python evaluate.py
    ```
4. **Model Deployment**: Deploy the model using the deployment script.
    ```bash
    python deploy.py
    ```

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset and data preprocessing scripts.
- `models/`: Contains the trained models.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for training, evaluating, and deploying the model.
